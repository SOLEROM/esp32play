# Component Registry 

The IDF Component Manager is a tool that downloads dependencies for any ESP-IDF CMake project. The download happens automatically during a run of CMake. It can source components either from the ESP Component Registry or from a Git repository.

Dependencies for each component in the project are defined in a separate manifest file named idf_component.yml placed in the root of the component.
